4/28/22, 10:00 AM - +91 83105 48920: Dear Academy Partners,

 

In an ongoing effort to set skilling as a national priority and transform India into a digital talent hub, Cisco, AICTE, and NASSCOM, FutureSkills PRIME have launched the next phase of the internship program to provide virtual internships in Networking, Programming and Cyber Security through Cisco Networking Academy and its partners.  This unique collaboration between industry and government will help build a skilled talent pool for tech jobs in the industry. This is NOT to be confused with Cisco India's Standard Internship Program (managed through Cisco's career page)

 

We seek your support to encourage students to apply for the Virtual Internships at https://internship.aicte-india.org/cisco.php


Virtual Internship details:

Students from Cisco Networking Academy institutions from 1st, 2nd & 3rd year engineering/technical degree courses may participate in the program.  
Students must complete the registration process at AICTE internship portal (https://internship.aicte-india.org/) and then start completing the identified courses by contacting their NetAcad instructor at their institution and completing their courses on netacad.com or via Cisco internships pathway at FutureSkills PRIME
Students will be requested to provide proof of course completion and digital badges should they be approved for the virtual internship program.
Those students approved will be invited to attend a Cisco industry session.  Students will work under the guidance of their NetAcad instructor to work on the problem statement assigned to them.
On completion and submission of their project work, students will be required to undertake a final quiz.
Eligible students who have completed all criteria will receive a virtual internship certificate.
 

For any further support, please contact NetAcad instructor at your institution or write to virtualinternship@external.cisco.com

Today was my last working day at FET, Jain Deemed - To - Be University. It has been a pleasure knowing such amazing students who have been extremely talented not just in academics, but other aspects as well, the memories of which I'll carry forward in my journey. I'd like to thank everyone for all the support and coordination during my service period. I'm a little nostalgic thinking of the last 5 years. I wish everyone all the best, don't just be average graduates, ace it, and be the top performers in your careers! 

Regards,
